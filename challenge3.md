# DeepX Front-end Challenge

## Description

The challenge is to build a front-end application using HTML/CSS and any language/framework you want to list GitHub issues and mark them as favorites.

You are free to use any stack (language/framework) you want (like React, Angular, Vue, Elm, etc) and we will also evaluate your knowledge about the technologies you selected for this challenge.

## Requirements

The application to be developed needs to have the basic four features:

- List issues using the Github API.
- Sort issues either by id or state.
- Favorite issues.
- Navigate to a different screen that will have all the issues that were favorited.

Please note that the intent of any challenge is not to 'solve the problem', but showcase good practices while solving the problem.

Feel free to take as much time as you want and send us the code when you feel comfortable with.

## Tips

- The design is up to you!
- Tests are always welcome.
