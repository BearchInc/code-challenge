# Deepx's Front-end Challenge

## Description

The challenge is to build a front-end application using HTML/CSS and any language/framework you want for listing GitHub issues and and marking them as favorites.

You are free to use any stack (language/framework) you want (like React, Angular, Vue, Elm, etc) and we will also evaluate your knowledge about the technologies you selected for this challenge.

## Requirements

The application to be developed needs to meet the basic 4 requirements:

- List issues using the Github API.
- Sort issues either by id or state.
- Favorite issues.
- Navigate to a different screen that will have all the issues that were favorited.

The design is up to you!

Feel free to take as much time as you want and send us the code when you feel comfortable with.

## Tips

- You are free to use CSS pre-processors if you want to.
- You can decide whether you want to manage state or not in the application.
- Tests are always welcome.
