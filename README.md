# DeepX Challenge

Hey! We want to take a look at your coding skills.

We have different challenges and you can select the one you feel you are going to do the best in.
Each different challenge has its own description, requirements and may have specifications on what will also be evaluated from your code.

Read everything carefully and please ask any questions you want about the evaluation or the challenges.

## What will overall be evaluated from your challenge resolution

Your problem solving skills, abilites with Git, the languages and frameworks selected to solve the challenges and your decision making skills will be evaluated. We also expect you to be able to deliver good quality code and your code will be evaluated in some specific aspects:

1. Static Analysis:
    - Code Quality
    - Standards conformity
    - Branching, Complexity and Data Flow
2. Semantic Analysis:
    - Deliverability
    - Testability
    - Coherence
    - Cohesion
    - Coupling

Everything you do will be evaluated.
Keep in mind that each challenge is for a different development area (mobile, backend, frontend) and your knowledge on the stack, tools, frameworks and everything related to the specific area will also be evaluated.

**Please do not forget to write a good README file with instructions to run and test your code :).**

## Important Notes

- If you have any questions, reach out to us and we will gladly help, you are not going to be penalized by this.
- Take as much time as needed and **communicate as much as necessary**.
- The challenges are not about something that 'solves the problem', but something that solves the problem while showcasing good practices and the best of your abilities.
- Write the best code that you can, in the language you are most confortable with. Do not try a fancy language just to showcase how fast can you learn something.
